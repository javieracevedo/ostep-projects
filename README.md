### Initial Projects

- Unix utilities
  - [wcat](./initial-utilities/wcat): variant of the unix tool **cat**, reads a file and print it's content.
  - [wgrep](./initial-utilities/wgrep): variant of the unix tool **grep**, searches in a file line by line the occurence of a search term and prints the line if its found.
  - [wzip](./initial-utilities/wzip): utility that compresses a text file using the compression algorithm RLE.
