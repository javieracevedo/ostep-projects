# OSTEP Projects

This are my solutions to the [projects](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects) of Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)

# C/Linux Projects

### Initial Projects

- **Unix utilities**
  - [wcat](./initial-utilities/wcat): variant of the unix tool **cat**, reads a file and print it's content.
  - [wgrep](./initial-utilities/wgrep): variant of the unix tool **grep**, searches in a file line by line the occurence of a search term and prints the line if its found.
  - [wzip](./initial-utilities/wzip): compresses a text file using the RLE compression algorithm.
  - [wunzip](./initial-utilities/wunzip): uncompresses text files compressed with the RLE compression algorithm.****

- **Others**
  - [reverse](./initial-utilities/reverse): reverses a file and writes it back to another file or stdout.
  - [sort-text](./initial-utilities/sort-text): sorts all lines in a stream, character by character and prints out the result to stdout or a file.

### Processes and Scheduling

- [shell](./processes-and-scheduling/shell): simple shell (called wish) written in C.

### Concurrency

- TODO

### File Systems

- TODO
