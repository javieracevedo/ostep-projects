# Introduction

The goal is to write small program that sorts text. It should be invoked in the following ways:

```
./sort-text
./sort-text input.txt
./sort-text input.txt output.txt
```

- **The first invocation**: implies that the program can read the text from the `stdin` and print the sorted text to `stdout`.
- **The second invocation**: implies that the program can read the text from file and print the sorted text to `stdout`.
- **The third invocation**: implies the same as the second invocation, except the output gets printed to a file (the second argument).

The file's text should be sorted line by line. Read one line, sort it by character and then move on to the next line, until EOF. Then print the result to stdout or an output file.

# Details

- **Invalid files**:
- **Too many arguments**:
- **Malloc fails**:
- **Printing error messages**:
- **Sorting**: 

## Tips

**Start with a simple sorting algorithm**, regardless of it being slow. If motivated, try to implement more efficient sorting algoritms. Make sure you understand how the given sorting algorithm works before trying to implement it.

**Testing**, TODO
